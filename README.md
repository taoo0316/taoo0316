### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I am  a computer science student and a budding data scientist. I am always looking to grow my technical skillsets and learn more about the world of technology.
- 🧠 I am also a student a Yale-NUS College, the leading liberal arts college in Asia. There, I was able to take classes across disciplines and academic traditions, which helped me become a more methodical thinker, learner and communicator. 
- 📫 How to reach me: zhu.wentao[at]u[dot]yale-nus[dot]edu[dot]sg.
- 👨‍💻 I will be applying for (and hopefully enroll in) a master's program in data science in fall 2024.
Check out what projects I have been up to!
