### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am  a computer science student and a budding data scientist. I am always looking to grow my technical skillsets and learn more about the world of technology.
- ðŸ§  I am also a student a Yale-NUS College, the leading liberal arts college in Asia (2013-2025:D). There, I was able to take classes from various disciplines and academic traditions, which helped me become a more methodical thinker, learner and communicator.
