### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I am  a computer science student and a budding data scientist. I am always looking to grow my technical skillsets and learn more about the world of technology.

- 🧠 I am also a student a Yale-NUS College, the leading liberal arts college in Asia. There, I was able to take classes across disciplines and academic traditions, which helped me become a more methodical thinker, learner and communicator. 

- 👨‍💻 I will be applying for master's programs in data science/machine learning in 2024.
